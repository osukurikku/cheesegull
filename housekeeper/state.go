//   B: Ah, I'm afraid that I only have the version updated 10 hours ago.
//      Mind downloading the updated version for me?
//      ----
//   A: Yo, is this beatmap cached?
//   B: Nope, I didn't know it existed before you told me. I've recorded its
//      info now, but jokes on you, you now have to actually download it.
